# Using Azure Batch Shipyard to train Deep Learning Models
This repo contains a number of example notebooks to run Deep Learning models on GPUs using Azure Batch Shipyard.

* [CIFAR Example](cifar_example) Creates a simple 3 layer convolution network which is then trained and evaluated against the CIFAR10 dataset.
